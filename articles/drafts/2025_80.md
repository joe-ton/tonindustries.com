> Missing From Most Engineer/Architect Conversations



TLDR: It's Small Talk...  
    
>Context:

    Successful tech careers revolve around a single principle: visible impact

    We often assume developers and architects are recognized and rewarded strictly for their direct contributions—designing, building, and guiding a project from concept to production. However, reality isn't always that straightforward. Engineers may deliver substantial value yet sometimes find their efforts overlooked if their impact isn't clearly visible to stakeholders.

    Conversely, tech personalities or influencers often gain praise, not because they've directly created a product or service, but because their contributions are highly visible and resonate widely—even if primarily reactionary.

    This disparity highlights why combining genuine impact with clear visibility is crucial. To thrive in the tech industry, professionals must not only deliver tangible results but also effectively communicate and highlight the significance of their contributions.

Summary: Be the Lighthouse, Not Just the Engine


>Solution: 

    Strangely, after years in the tech industry, I've discovered that the number one challenge isn't technical—it's communication. More specifically, it's aligning people toward shared goals.

    To achieve alignment effectively, think of every meeting as two meetings: one small and one deep.

    I wasn't always this way. Like many well-intentioned engineers, I used to jump straight into solving problems, dismissing small talk as an unnecessary distraction. This was true even in my personal life. I believed cutting to the chase made me efficient.

    But genuine effectiveness requires connection, and connection starts with introductions and small talk.

    Here's a quick story that illustrates this lesson perfectly:

    My dad is an accomplished architect with many more years in his industry than I have in mine. He often takes his clients out to dinner, wining and dining them, and frequently picking up the tab. When I asked him why, his answer was simple yet profound:

    "Because people want to work with people they like."

    He also shared a scenario from his management experience. Two architects under him were equally valuable, each handling projects of similar impact. However, one was far more visible especially to the VP of the company.

    Guess who received the better annual review?

The lesson is clear: technical skills are crucial, but the power of communication—and the connection it fosters—is often what truly drives success.

Summary: Small Talks, Deep Walks (this was totally original lol)


>Action 1: Small Talk

    Neutral -> General -> Specific

    ex. 
    - "Hello, my name is Joe"
    - "Lots of things are happenning"
    - "Let's talk about something specific"

>Action 2: Asking Clarity

When engineers dig deeper into technical challenges, we often ask direct questions like, "Do you know [topic]?" For instance, "Are you familiar with REST vs. gRPC API structures?" This style works fine privately or among close colleagues.

However, human psychology changes in group situations or when interacting with unfamiliar team members, meetups, or potential clients. Such direct questions might unintentionally cause embarrassment or discomfort. Even if the intent is purely technical clarity, some engineers can feel defensive or singled out, and others might even exploit these moments to showcase their expertise at another’s expense.

Correcting misunderstandings or gaps in knowledge is necessary at times, but effectiveness comes from empathy, tact, and emotional awareness. Remember: tech communities can be surprisingly small, and unintentional slights can linger.

To foster a healthier environment and prevent these issues, consider framing your questions through this emotionally intelligent structure:

Empathy → Shared Intent → Inclusive Check-in

Empathy (Acknowledging complexity):
“We all know APIs can get complicated, and it’s completely normal to find certain aspects tricky.”

Shared Intent (Clarifying the goal):
“My goal here is to make sure we all feel aligned so we can collaborate effectively.”

Inclusive Check-in (Encouraging open dialogue):

“How does everyone feel about APIs right now? Is there something you’d find useful to go over together before moving on?”
    I would suggest we follow this structure.

    General -> Intent -> Feel
    1. Everyone can agree APIs can be complex. 
    2. I am trying to make sure we're aligned here.
    3. How do we feel about with APIs?

    Also, I don't want to sound like one of those self-help books.  If you detect a colleague has a habit of toxic behavior, obviously shut it down.  Advocate for yourself.  Get your manager involved and provide receipts.  Document everything.  Careful of HR -- remember they work for the company, not for you.

Action 3: Giving Feedback
    Ideally
    General -> Intent -> Feel
    - ""

Closing: Ping Before You Push

   For those less familiar with networking or Git terminology, "ping" means sending a quick check to confirm something (or someone!) is responsive. In software engineering, "Push" means confidently committing or delivering your code changes. At this point, I am just bragging about the metaphor I came up with lol

    In other words, always check-in gently with small talks before walking with
them into deeper conversations.  Smalls Talks, Deep Walks.  Ping Before you Push.
